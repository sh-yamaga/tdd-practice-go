# tdd-practice-go

This is personal practice of TDD.

I coded this project with reference to the first part: The Money Example of [Test-Driven Development By Example by Kent Beck](https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E3%83%86%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E9%A7%86%E5%8B%95%E9%96%8B%E7%99%BA-%EF%BC%AB%EF%BD%85%EF%BD%8E%EF%BD%94%EF%BC%A2%EF%BD%85%EF%BD%83%EF%BD%8B-ebook/dp/B077D2L69C/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&sr=).

The original sample code was written in Java, but I translated it into Go for practice.
